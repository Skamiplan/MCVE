# Entity Framework Core Unexpectedly Generates Redundant Foreign Key When Using `IEntityTypeConfiguration`

## Description

I encountered a unique behavior in Entity Framework Core (EF Core) when transitioning from a basic Fluent API setup within the \`DbContext.OnModelCreating\` method to a more structured approach using \`IEntityTypeConfiguration\`. The issue manifested as the unexpected generation of an additional foreign key column (\`TicketId1\`) in the \`Options\` table during migration.

### Key Points of the Issue

1. **Initial Setup**: Initially, the relationships between entities (\`Ticket\` and \`Option\`) were defined using either data annotations or basic Fluent API configurations within the \`DbContext\`. This setup did not result in any unexpected behavior regarding foreign keys.

2. **Transition to \`IEntityTypeConfiguration\`**: Upon transitioning to \`IEntityTypeConfiguration\` for more explicit entity configuration, EF Core's migration generation started including an additional, unintended foreign key column \`TicketId1\` in the \`Options\` table.

3. **Issue Resolution**: The issue was resolved by removing the redundant relationship definition from one side of the entity relationship. This adjustment prevented EF Core from generating the unnecessary \`TicketId1\` column.

4. **Possible Causes**: This behavior suggests a change in how EF Core interprets entity relationships when moving to a more explicit configuration style. The more structured \`IEntityTypeConfiguration\` approach possibly requires a more precise definition of relationships, highlighting any ambiguities that were not evident in the less structured configuration.

5. **Implications**: This scenario underscores the importance of clear and explicit relationship definitions in EF Core, particularly when using \`IEntityTypeConfiguration\`. It also highlights how transitioning configuration approaches can expose previously unnoticed issues or behaviors in EF Core's model interpretation.

## Conclusion

This MCVE aims to demonstrate and clarify the behavior observed when moving entity configurations to \`IEntityTypeConfiguration\`, specifically focusing on the unexpected generation of additional foreign keys in the database schema.
